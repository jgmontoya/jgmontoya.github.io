title: "First chapter of the Grokking Bitcoin book"
---

The first chapter of the book Grokking Bitcoin is a broad introduction to Bitcoin. It can be followed by anyone as it explains Bitcoin in a very high-level fashion. I would recommend this chapter to anyone interested in knowing more.

This chapter doesn't focus much on the technical aspects, as it tries to paint a generalized picture of the whole system, and it focuses more on the economic aspects ('Why Bitcoin?').
Basically, Bitcoin helps against the following problems with today's money:

* **Segregation**: Banking the unbanked. By being a permissionless system anyone can participate regardless of political views, ethnicity, nationality, sexual identity, skin color, etc.. All you need is an internet connection and a computer (or a smartphone).

* **Privacy**: Current electronic payment systems (such as credit cards or bank transfers) have little-to-no privacy. Add to this the fact that it is trivial for states to trace and censor payments and to freeze and seize accounts. It shouldn't be a surprise then that some states are pushing cash out as this gives almost complete information and control to whoever holds the political power. Bitcoin helps against this problem by not attaching a real identity to the coins and by being permissionless. Basically anyone can generate a new pair of valid key pairs (i.e. valid addresses and the keys to spend them) without providing any kind of identifying information.

* **Inflation**: Perhaps one of the most important aspects of Bitcoin is the protection it offers against inflation. Bitcoin is scarce, and will always be scarce as it has a finite supply that follows a well-defined monetary policy. As every single fiat currency is *printed* arbitrarily by central banks all around the world, Bitcoin has and will continue to have a completely predictable number of new coins entering the network. There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins. Our savings in Bitcoin can't be diluted.

* **Borders**: Bitcoin is global and borderless. It's completely irrelevant the country where the people involved in a transaction (on either end) are. Bitcoin doesn't care about economic sanctions, tariffs or any other arbitrary imposition. It gets rid of the middlemen as it allows for true peer-to-peer electronic transfer of value.

One of the most powerful images is this one:

As it shows the incredible raise in price that Bitcoin in it's first decade as well as how insignificant the high-volatility movements of the price look now. Is this how the December 2017 raise will look in the future? No one knows for sure, but my bet is that it is.
