Hello and  welcome,

I plan to follow a Book and try to dive deep into Bitcoin, from a technical point of view. The purpose of this blog is to document my journey through Bitcoin and in doing so, helping me verbalize my thoughts about it.

My next steps will be to take a look at the following books:

* [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook) by Andreas Antonopoulos ([@aantonop](https://twitter.com/aantonop))
* [Grokking Bitcoin](http://rosenbaum.se/book/) by Kalle Rosenbaum ([@kallerosenbaum](https://twitter.com/kallerosenbaum))
* [Programming Bitcoin](https://github.com/jimmysong/programmingbitcoin) by Jimmy Song ([@jimmysong](https://twitter.com/jimmysong))

I will then choose one to try and follow along. My idea is to then write here some posts regarding my advances through it. Currently I am not really sure about what I want to do so that's why I'm exploring the space from this perspective. My plan is to develop a solid enough knowledge and practice in the space to be able to work at a Bitcoin company or to start a Bitcoin-related project.

See you around and hold the citadel door open for me!
